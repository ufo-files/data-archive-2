This is shard 2 of the [UFO Files](https://ufo-files.app) public source archive.
It preserves original source material while retaining the source-relative paths
used across the archive.

The archive is split across multiple GitHub repositories to keep it browsable
as it grows. A source folder may appear in more than one shard; those folders
contain different portions of the same collection. Use the directory below to
navigate the complete public archive.

## What Is Preserved

- Original PDFs, images, videos, audio, and other downloaded source files
- Source-specific folder names and relative paths
- Manifests, checksums, and collection metadata where supplied by the archiver
- Git history showing when files entered the public archive

ZIP packages, temporary files, processing state, and derived OCR or transcript
output are excluded from the public source-file count. The live badge is built
from the union of all numbered archive shards and deduplicates matching relative
paths.

## Finding Derived Data

This repository preserves source files. Searchable OCR, transcripts,
thumbnails, and normalized corpus records live in
[`ufo-files/data`](https://github.com/ufo-files/data). Explore relationships
derived from that corpus in the
[`relationship-graph`](https://github.com/ufo-files/relationship-graph).

## Provenance

An archived file records what a source published; its presence does not verify
the claims it contains or imply endorsement by UFO Files. Source material may
include disputed, historical, testimonial, journalistic, or government records.
Consult each file's collection metadata and original publisher when evaluating
provenance.
